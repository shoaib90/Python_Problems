# #problem

# There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets,A  and B, each containing m integers. 
# You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0. 
# For each i integer in the array, if iâˆˆA, you add 1 to your happiness. If iâˆˆB, you add -1 to your happiness. 
# Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

# Note: Since A and B are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array might contain duplicate elements.

# Input Format

# The first line contains integers n and m separated by a space.
# The second line contains n integers, the elements of the array.
# The third and fourth lines contain m integers, A and B, respectively.

# Output Format

# Output a single integer, your total happiness.

# Sample Input

# 3 2
# 1 5 3
# 3 1
# 5 7
# Sample Output

# 1
